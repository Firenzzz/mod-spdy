#summary Getting started with mod_spdy.

= Introduction =

To install mod_spdy you will also need to install a version of mod_ssl with NPN support enabled.

= Details =

== 1. Build mod_ssl with NPN support ==

{{{
mkdir modssl
cd modssl
svn export http://mod-spdy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/build_modssl_with_npn.sh
./build_modssl_with_npn.sh 
}}}

Wait for the build to complete.

== 2. Install mod_ssl ==

Install mod_ssl.so in your Apache modules directory. This may be e.g. `/usr/lib/apache2/modules` if you are using Ubuntu, or some other location depending on your system.

Instructions for Ubuntu:
{{{
sudo cp mod_ssl.so /usr/lib/apache2/modules
sudo a2enmod ssl
}}}

== 3. Configure mod_ssl ==

Instructions for generating a self-signed certificate on Ubuntu:
{{{
sudo apt-get install ssl-cert
make-ssl-cert /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf /tmp/selfsigned.crt
# Enter your hostname. Any hostname will do for testing.
sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl
sudo mv /tmp/selfsigned.crt /etc/apache2/ssl
emacs /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.
 # Find the line for SSLCertificateFile and update it to point at your new crt file.
 # Comment out the line immediately following, for SSLCertificateKeyFile
sudo a2ensite default-ssl
}}}
