#summary Known compatibility issues, and workarounds.

 * Since mod_spdy uses a thread pool to process multiplexed requests concurrently, it is not compatible with non-thread-safe Apache modules such as `mod_php`.  If you use `mod_php` or another non-thread-safe generator, you can use it with mod_spdy by running it with [http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/ mod_fcgid]. We have successfully run an Apache server with SPDY, PHP and !WordPress by using `mod_fcgid` instead of `mod_php`.

 * mod_spdy is currently not compatible with mod_ssl's SSLRequireSSL directive; see issue 31.  There is no known workaround at this time except to simply not use the SSLRequireSSL directive.

 * Some users whose sites redirect http urls to https have experienced redirect loops after installing mod_spdy.  If this happens, please see issue 34 for a workaround that may help.
